# Building a spotify player in React

I used this project to learn to use react and the spotify api, I followed this tutorial: https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-build-a-spotify-player-with-react-in-15-minutes-7e01991bc4b6 by Joe Karlsson

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## When you run the project

### You need to login with your spotify account

The key provided is my personal key, in order to login with your spotify account you need to provide your own deeloper code and register http://localhost:3000 as ridirect, then put the spotify key in your config file

### Then listen to something in spotify with your account and you will see it on your custom React web page
